- 👋 Hi, I’m @ChewGamers
- 👀 I’m interested in improving my modded DAYZ server(s) I use to host PvP tournaments once a month (so I can get enough players to host several tournaments a month) as well as other game servers.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning/taking XML classes to imporve my skills to help others as well as myself.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on several things, however currently I'm wanting to make better PvP servers for the tournaments I hold monthly.
- 📫 How to reach me I'm ChewGamers on all social media or you can PM/DM me directly at ChewGamers@gmail.com or ChewGamers@aol.com (yes I've been around that long lol)
